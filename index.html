        <p>This github shows my experiments with coding on various platforms. I love to try out new things. Currently, I am learning Python from CS212 on Udacity. Along with it, I am making a few ruby on rails projects - basically just learning by doing. I work with a U.S. based startup and here I do development in Python. I don't think I am very good with programming but I genuinely enjoy experimenting. Let's see where I get. </p>
