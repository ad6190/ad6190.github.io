title: SDE Hiring Process
---


I have taken over 100 technical interviews in the last one year. These have comprised technical and behavioural interviews for SDE 1, 2 and 3 for backend and as well as frontend. 

Note: I have a strong opinion on fullstack hiring and as much as possible, I keep frontend and backend disciplines separate. One should know the basics of both backend and frontend, but for full time hires, who are required to solve problems of at least some degree of depth, it is important to have an area of expertise or be willing to develop in an area eventually. 

With zoom fatigue during covid, interviewing can be challenging. It is important to be effectiv. Being clear on the parameters to be assessed is an absolute must, to avoid wasting both the interviewer's and interviewee's time. Key points that help me as an interviewer:
- Be clear on the expectations out of the 30 or 45 or 60 mins. Have a list of specific skills being assessed for eg. in communication, it could be technical explanation that they should be able to drill down or it could be articulation, where they are able to express what help they need to arrive at solution. Competency matrix is a good place to get these skills. 
- Once the specific skillset is clear, create rating questions on each of them. 
- Keep rating simple. It can be unimpressive, decent, highly impressive. It leaves less room for interpretation. 
- Structure the interview as per the expectations instead of going by common interview formats. For eg. if OOP concepts are to be checked, then there are two options - asking them to build an application which would take significant time or asking them to review code with clear OOP flaws. The second could yield same result, faster.
- Question the relevance of each round. If the world asks questions on DSA, do not just copy paste the format. In frontend, DSA is better checked after applying to relevant areas. For eg DOM is a tree and a tree/list question using DOM manipulation can add a flavour to the usual/rote-learned DSA questions. It can be used to check if the candidate can apply what they have learnt. 
- As the level goes from 1 to 2 to 3, the interviewer should be able to use the same question and expect answers with varying depth. This understanding of what to expect at a level for a single question, helps in identifying clear winners. For frontend, this question can be how does the browser work. For backend, it could be design a cli game.
