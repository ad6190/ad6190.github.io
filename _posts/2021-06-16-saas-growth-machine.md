title: SaaS Growth Machine

Few indicators of growth machines:

- Should aim to build a repeatable, scalable, profitable growth machine
- The no. 1 indicator for saas should be growing no. of bookings
- bookings = lead flow * funnel conversion rates * average deal size
- bookings when there are sales rep = no of reps * PPR (productivity per rep)
- ARR has a linear growth with flat bookings
- ARR shows exponential growth with growing bookings 
- Hence, instead of ARR, focus on net new ARR
- Net new ARR = New ARR + Expansion ARR - Churn ARR
- CAC < LTV, more specifically for a growth machine, LTV > 3 * CAC
- Recover CAC in 12-18 months
- Negative churn => expansion revenue > revenue from lost customers 
- Expansion revenue means variable price is required
- Variable price can be based on 
	- price for features
	- price on number of users
	- price from depth of usage (infra cost, etc.)
- Classify churn as customer churn vs dollar churn
