## Hi! Thanks for visiting my online home.


I have a few key principles that help me lead a peaceful life:
-  keep things simple 
-  leave them better than they were found
-  believe nothing is impossible
-  ask if the hill is worth dying on

I use this space to record my growth and observations as I go through life. Hope to someday connect the dots backwards.

[SQL is hard]() — If you’re like most devs, you don’t write SQL. Instead you write less efficient and less maintainable data processing code in JavaScript, Python, etc. You miss out on the real power of your database. Why? Because SQL is mysterious, and you don't know what it can do for you.

[It's not as easy as just going to bed]() — You think to yourself “I should go to bed”, but you don’t actually move. You continue coding, writing, gaming, binge-watching, or doom-scrolling.
