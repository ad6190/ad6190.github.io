title: Hi! Thanks for visiting my online home.

I have a few key principles that help me lead a peaceful life:
-  keep things simple 
-  leave things better than they were found
-  believe nothing is impossible
-  ask if the hill is worth dying on

I use this space to record my growth and observations as I go through life. Hope to someday connect the dots backwards.
